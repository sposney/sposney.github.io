				<span>Hi, I’m Steve.</span>  
		
				<span>I’m a Pittsburgh-based UX Designer working at Innovative Systems, Inc. At Innovative, I established the UX team a couple years ago and currently work on the full gamut when it comes to the design thinking process, from conducting ethnographic research to crafting high-fidelity prototypes. In a past life, I was an aspiring software engineer - I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in Computer Science and minors in both Human-Computer Interaction and Business Administration. </span>  
		
				<span>I’m particularly passionate about understanding people and the processes they follow every day. I’m in my element when I’m diagramming sequence models and analyzing how they can be streamlined. I’m a proponent of simplicity and I love the feeling of accomplishment from translating insights gained from research into efficient, effective, high-quality designs that solve problems for people.</span>
		
				<span>I enjoy taking on extra projects outside of my 9-5 if I have the bandwidth, as I’m a big proponent of maintaining a good work-life balance. I make time outside of work for rooting on the major Pittsburgh sports teams (yes, even the Pirates), cooking in my Instant Pot, staying in shape, and hanging out with family and friends. If you’re looking for some design work or just want to grab coffee and chat, feel free to reach out! </span>
